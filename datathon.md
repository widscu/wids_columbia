# Datathon Challenge 2024

The WiDS Datathon is an opportunity to discover and hone data science skills while solving an interesting and critical social impact challenge. Whether you are an aspiring data scientist or a data science enthusiast, WiDS provides a supportive environment for participants to connect, share interests, learn from, help each other, and have a lot of fun!


### 7th Annual WiDS Datathon 2024 Challenges: Equity in Healthcare 

Gilead Sciences is the sponsor for this yearâ€™s Datathon. They provided a rich, real-world dataset which contains information about demographics, diagnosis and treatment options, and insurance provided about patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 2015-2018. The dataset originated from Health Verity, one of the largest healthcare data ecosystems in the US. It was enriched with third party geo-demographic data to provide views into the socio economic aspects that may contribute to health equity.
